# Milestone Project 2 - Stoke City Memory Game for younger fans.

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/images/stoke-city-fc-2.png"></h2>

## Purpose

For this project I intend to design a memory game for younger Stoke City fans. This game will be constructed using knowledge gained so far on the HTML, CSS and javascript modules. The goal of the game is for children to match all the cards of their favourite players. Feedback is given when every card is matched by the player.

The live website can be found here. [link](https://robappleby1.github.io/Milestone-Project-2---stoke-city-memory-game-for-kids)

# Stoke City Memory Game.

The memory game will be aimed at younger Stoke City fans, who will have to match pairs of images based on the club, for example players and the stadium etc.

This game is aimed at the younger generation of fans, aimed at the 8 - 10 yars old age bracket. This idea is inspired by my daughter who has just started attending matches, and wants to learn more about the club and the players.

# User Experience Design

### First Time Visitor Goals

- As a first time user I need to easily navigate through the game and be able to easily understand the rules.
- As a first time user I need to be able to view the website clearly on both tablet and mobile, as well as desktop.
- As a first time user I need to be able to easily play the game, through responsive design.
- As a first time user I need to be able to find out further information about the club via a link to their website.

### Returning Visitor Goals

- As a returning visitor I want to be able to easily find a way to play the game gain.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

The colours I intend to use for the site are Red (rgbn255,0,0) and black (rgb 0,0,0).
This will fit in well with the club's existing team colours, and will immediately be recognised by the young fans playing the game.

<br />

# Typography

The logo will be made up of a title block which incorporates the clubs badge. The badge will be a link to their existing website.

- Prompt (Including all font weights)
A sans-serif font which will easily fit into the clubs existing brand styling.


<br />

# Structure

The page will contain a fixed emblem at title block at the top of the page, which will easily identify what the page is all about. The title block will consist of the clubs badge, which will be a link to the clubs website. On the left hand side will be a text block which will incorporate a small section on information about the club, and also the rules of the game, and how to play it. On the right hand side will be the game block itself.
